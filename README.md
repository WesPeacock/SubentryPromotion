# Subentry Promotion
This repo contains scripts to process SFM lexical records to promote sub-entries to full entry records. The promoted entry has a marker pointing back to the entry it was under.

FLEx 8 imports sub-entries as variants rather than as complex forms. One of the scripts changes them. It includes a mechanism to modify the comlex form type.

This repo was migrated from theWes Peacock Nkonya dictionary Script directory in June 2019
